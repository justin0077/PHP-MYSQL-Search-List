# Project Explanation

In this repository you can find my PHP search input project.
The list uses MYSQL data and fetches it inside this list.
As extra feature, you can use the alphabet at the top of the search input.
With this alphabet you can select the specific letter and the list gives back the result of all words that start with that letter.
